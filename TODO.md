TODO

- tests
- remove jquery implementation/dependency when fullpage.js v3 is ready and update props + imports
- make a react-fullpage.js gh-pages site that either uses the same markup ups fullpgae.js or another agreed upon layout (should be simple as this repo is a wrapper around markup and events)

- redo jsdoc state docs for v3
